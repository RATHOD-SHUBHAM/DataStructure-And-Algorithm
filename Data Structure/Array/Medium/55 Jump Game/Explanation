target is to reach end  of array.
So start from the end -1 and check if we can reach the end from there


Step 1: check if you can reach index 4 from index 3


  0  1  2  3  4
[ 2, 3, 1, 1, 4 ]

target = 4 (index of last element)

at index 3 we are allowed max jump of one 
so after that jump we will reach index 4 -- > 3 + 1


If we are  able to reach the end then we reduce the target to current index
  0  1  2  3  4
[ 2, 3, 1, 1, 4 ]

now target = 3
i = 2

from i we are alllowed max jump of 1 so 2 + 1 = 3

we will reach index 3

again reduce the target to 2
now check if we can reach index 2 from index 1

from index 1 we are allowed to jump at max 3 so 1 + 3 = 4

2 < 4 : we can reach 2

now reduce target and i

from index 0 we can jump max of 2 steps

target <= i + nums[i]


Now we will return true when target is at index 0.
This will say us that we can reach the ned of the array from index 0.
