Given N glasses having water, and a list A of each of their capacity. 
The task is to find the minimum number of bottles required to fill out exactly K glasses. 
The capacity of each bottle is 100 units. 

Examples:  

Input: N = 4, K = 3, arr[] = {200, 150, 140, 300} 
Output: 5 
We have to fill out exactly 3 glasses. 
So we fill out 140, 150, 200 whose sum is 490, so we need 5 bottles for this.


Input: N = 5, K = 4, arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1} 
Output: 1
