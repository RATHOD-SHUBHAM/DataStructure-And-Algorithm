161. One Edit Distance

Given two strings s and t, return true if they are both one edit distance apart, otherwise return false.

A string s is said to be one distance apart from a string t if you can:

Insert exactly one character into s to get t.
Delete exactly one character from s to get t.
Replace exactly one character of s with a different character to get t.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ab", t = "acb"
Output: true
Explanation: We can insert 'c' into s to get t.
Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = ""
Output: false
Explanation: We cannot get t from s by only one step.
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length, t.length <= 104
s and t consist of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits.
