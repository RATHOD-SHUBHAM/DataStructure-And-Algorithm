#  Greedy solution for the Valid Parentheses

# Core Concept
The greedy approach tracks the range of possible open parentheses counts at each position. Instead of exploring all possibilities (like recursion), we maintain:

    * min_open: minimum possible unmatched '(' count
    * max_open: maximum possible unmatched '(' count

# Why Track a Range?
When we encounter *, it can be:

    1. ( - increases open count
    2. ) - decreases open count
    3. Empty string - no change

Since we don't know which choice to make yet, we track all possibilities as a range.

# The Confusing Parts Explained
    1. if max_open == -1: return False
    ```
    if max_open == -1:
        return False
    ```
    What this means: Even in the best case scenario (where we treat * optimally), we still have more ')' than '('.
    
    Example:
    ```
    s = "))"
    Position 0: max_open = -1 (we have one ')' but no '(' to match it)
    ```

    If even our most optimistic estimate fails, the string is definitely invalid.
    
    2. if min_open == -1: min_open = 0
    ```
    if min_open == -1:
        min_open = 0
    ```
    What this means: In the worst case scenario, we can always use * as empty string to avoid going negative.
    Example:
    ```
    s = "*)"
    After processing ')':
    - min_open = -1 (if we treated '*' as ')')
    - But we can treat '*' as empty instead!
    - So we reset min_open = 0
    ```
    We're saying: "Even if our pessimistic estimate goes negative, we can always make * disappear to keep the count at 0."

# Visual Example
Let's trace through s = "(*))"

Position | Char | min_open | max_open | Explanation
---------|------|----------|----------|-------------
0        | (    | 1        | 1        | Must be '('
1        | *    | 0        | 2        | * can be ')' or '('
2        | )    | -1→0     | 1        | Match one ')'
3        | )    | -1→0     | 0        | Match another ')'


At position 2:

    * min_open = -1 but we reset to 0 (we can make * empty)
    * max_open = 1 (we can make * be ()

At position 3:

    * min_open = -1 but we reset to 0
    * max_open = 0 (perfect match!)

Since min_open ≤ 0 at the end, the string is valid.

## Why This Works
The key insight is:

    * max_open < 0: Impossible even with optimal * choices → Invalid
    * min_open < 0: We can always make * empty to avoid this → Reset to 0
    * min_open ≤ 0 at end: We can achieve perfect balance → Valid

The greedy approach works because we only need to know if a valid assignment exists, not find the actual assignment.

# max_open and min_open
max_open catches the immediate "impossible" cases, but min_open is crucial for the final validation. Let me show you why we need both.

## Why We Need min_open: The Final Check
The key is in the return condition:
```
return min_open <= 0
```

We need min_open to ensure that in the worst case scenario, we can still achieve a balanced string (0 unmatched parentheses).

### Example Where max_open Passes But min_open Fails
Consider: s = "(((*"

Let's trace it:
Position | Char | min_open | max_open | Status
---------|------|----------|----------|--------
0        | (    | 1        | 1        | 
1        | (    | 2        | 2        | 
2        | (    | 3        | 3        | 
3        | *    | 2        | 4        | * can be ')' or '('

Final state:

    * max_open = 4 ✓ (never went negative)
    * min_open = 2 ✗ (cannot reach 0)

What this means:

    * Best case (max_open = 4): We treated * as (, so we have 4 unmatched (
    * Worst case (min_open = 2): We treated * as ), so we still have 2 unmatched (

Since even in the worst case we have 2 unmatched (, there's no way to make this string balanced. We'd need 2 more ) characters.

## Another Example: s = "***"

Position | Char | min_open | max_open 
---------|------|----------|----------
0        | *    | -1→0     | 1        
1        | *    | -1→0     | 2        
2        | *    | -1→0     | 3

Final state:

    * max_open = 3 ✓
    * min_open = 0 ✓

This is valid because:

    * Worst case (min_open = 0): Treat all * as empty → balanced
    * Best case (max_open = 3): Treat all * as ( → 3 unmatched, but that's not the point

Since min_open = 0, we know there exists at least one way to make it balanced.

## The Two-Phase Logic

1. During iteration (max_open check):

    * "Is it possible to continue without having too many )?"


2. At the end (min_open check):

    * "Is it possible to end with exactly 0 unmatched parentheses?"


Both conditions must be satisfied. max_open ensures we don't fail early, but min_open ensures we can actually reach a valid final state.

# Another Example
Let's trace through s = ")))"

## Tracing s = ")))"
Position | Char | min_open | max_open | Status
---------|------|----------|----------|--------
0        | )    | -1       | -1       | Both go negative

What happens:

    * min_open = 0 - 1 = -1
    * max_open = 0 - 1 = -1

Since max_open == -1, we immediately return False.

## Why max_open Catches This
The check if max_open == -1: return False catches this case because:

    * max_open represents our most optimistic scenario
    * Even if we had infinite * characters that we could treat as (, we still couldn't handle this )
    * If our best-case scenario fails, there's no point continuing

The Key Insight
For ))):

    * We have 3 closing parentheses
    * We have 0 opening parentheses
    * We have 0 wildcards

Even in the most optimistic world, we can't create opening parentheses out of thin air to match these closing ones.

# Contrast with s = "*))"
Position | Char | min_open | max_open | Status
---------|------|----------|----------|--------
0        | *    | -1→0     | 1        | * can be '(' or ')'
1        | )    | -1→0     | 0        | One ')' matched
2        | )    | -1→0     | -1       | Too many ')'

Here, max_open becomes -1 at position 2, so we return False.
Why? Even if we optimally used * as (, we still have one unmatched ).

# The Pattern
The max_open == -1 check catches any scenario where we have structurally too many ) characters, regardless of how we assign the * wildcards. This is why we can immediately return False - there's no possible assignment that could make the string valid.

# Practical Interview Strategy
```
# Say this out loud:
"I'll start with a recursive solution to make sure I understand the problem,
then we can optimize it together."

# After recursion works:
"I notice I'm recalculating the same states. The bottleneck seems to be 
tracking exact counts when there's uncertainty from wildcards..."

# If stuck:
"Could you give me a hint about a different way to track the state?"
