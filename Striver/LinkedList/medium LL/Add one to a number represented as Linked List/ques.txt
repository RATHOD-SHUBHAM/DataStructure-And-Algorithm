Add one to a number represented as Linked List


Problem Statement



Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1:
3
1 5 2


Sample Output 1:
1 5 3


Explanation For Sample Input 1:
Initially the number is 152. After incrementing it by 1, the number becomes 153.


Sample Input 2:
2
9 9


Sample Output 2:
1 0 0


Explanation For Sample Input 2:
Initially the number is 9. After incrementing it by 1, the number becomes 100. Please note that there were 2 nodes in the initial linked list, but there are three nodes in the sum linked list.


Expected Time Complexity :
The expected time complexity is O('n').


Constraints:
1 <= 'n' <=  10^5
0 <= Node in linked list <= 9

There are no leading zeroes in the number.

Time Limit: 1 sec
