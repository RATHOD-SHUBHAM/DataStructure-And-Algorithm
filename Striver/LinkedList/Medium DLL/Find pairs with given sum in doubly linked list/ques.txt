Find pairs with given sum in doubly linked list

Problem Statement



Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample input 1:
5
1 2 3 4 9
5


Sample output 1
2
1 4
2 3


Explanation for sample input 1 :
There are 2 pairs in the linked list having sum equal to 'k' (= 5).


Sample input 2:
5
1 10 11 12 27
7


Sample output 2:
0


Explanation for sample output 2
There is no pair in the linked list with sum equal to 'k' (= 7).


Expected Time Complexity :
The expected time complexity is O('n').


Constraints:
2 <= 'n' <= 10 ^ 4
1 <= 'data' in any node <= 10 ^ 4
1 <= 'k' <= 10 ^ 4

'data' in every node is distinct.

Time limit: 1 second
