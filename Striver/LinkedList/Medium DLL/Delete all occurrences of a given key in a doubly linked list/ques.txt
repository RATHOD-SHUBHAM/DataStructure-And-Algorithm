Delete all occurrences of a given key in a doubly linked list


Problem Statement




Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1:
7
10 4 10 3 5 20 10
10


Sample Output 1:
4 3 5 20


Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
All the nodes having ‘data’ = 10 are removed from the linked list.


Sample Input 2:
7
10 4 10 3 5 20 10
30


Sample Output 2:
10 4 10 3 5 20 10


Explanation Of Sample Input 2:
The linked list does not have any node with ‘data’ = 30. So the linked list is unchanged.


Expected Time Complexity:
The expected time complexity is O(‘n’).


Constraints:
0 <= ‘n’ <= 100000
1 <= ‘data’ in any node <= 10^9
1 <= ‘k’ <= 10^9
