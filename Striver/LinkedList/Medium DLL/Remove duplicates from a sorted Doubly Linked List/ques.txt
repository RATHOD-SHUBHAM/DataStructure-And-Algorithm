Problem Statement



Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1 :
5
1 2 2 2 3


Sample Output 1 :
1 2 3


Explanation For Sample Input 1 :
We will delete the duplicate values ‘2’ present in the linked list.

4
1 2 3 4


Sample Output 2 :
1 2 3 4


Explanation For Sample Input 2 :
The list contains no duplicates, so the final list is unchanged.


Expected Time Complexity :
The expected time complexity is O('n').


Constraints :
1 <= 'n' <= 10^5
1 <= 'data' in any node <= 10^6

Time limit: 1 sec
