Delete node in Doubly Linked List

Given a doubly linked list and a position. The task is to delete a node from given position in a doubly linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList = 1 <--> 3 <--> 4 
x = 3
Output: 1 3  
Explanation: After deleting the node at
position 3 (position starts from 1),
the linked list will be now as 1->3.
Example 2:

Input:
LinkedList = 1 <--> 5 <--> 2 <--> 9  
x = 1
Output: 5 2 9
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function deleteNode() which should delete the node at given position and return the head of the linkedlist.

Expected Time Complexity : O(N)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1)

Constraints:
2 <= size of the linked list <= 1000
1 <= x <= N
