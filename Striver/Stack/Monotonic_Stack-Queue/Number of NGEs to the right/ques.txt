Number of NGEs to the right

Given an array of N integers and Q queries of indices. Return a list NGEs[] where NGEs[i] stores the count of elements strictly greater than the current element (arr[indices[i]]) to the right of indices[i].


Examples :

Input:  arr[]     = [3, 4, 2, 7, 5, 8, 10, 6]
        queries = 2
        indices[] = [0, 5]
Output:  6, 1
Explanation: The next greater elements to the right of 3(index 0) are 4,7,5,8,10,6. The next greater elements to the right of 8(index 5) is only 10.

Input:  arr[]     = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1]
        queries = 2
        indices[] = [0, 3]
Output:  3, 0
Explanation: The count of numbers to the right of index 0 which are greater than arr[0] is 3 i.e. (2, 3, 4). Similarly, the count of numbers to the right of index 3 which are greater than arr[3] is 0, since there are no greater elements than 4 to the right of the array.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N * queries).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(queries).


Constraints:
1 <= N <= 104
1 <= arr[i] <= 105
1 <= queries <= 100

0 <= indices[i] <= N - 1
