Given an array, print the Next Smaller Element (NSE) for every element. The NSE for an element x is the first smaller element on the right side of x in the array. Elements for which no smaller element exist (on the right side), consider NSE as -1. 

Examples: 

Input: [4, 8, 5, 2, 25]
Output: [2, 5, 2, -1, -1]
Explanation:
The first element smaller than 4 having index > 0 is 2.
The first element smaller than 8 having index > 1 is 5.
The first element smaller than 5 having index > 2 is 2.
There are no elements smaller than 4 having index > 3.
There are no elements smaller than 4 having index > 4.

Input: [13, 7, 6, 12]
Output: [7, 6, -1, -1]
Explanation:
The first element smaller than 13 having index > 0 is 7.
The first element smaller than 7 having index > 1 is 6.
There are no elements smaller than 6 having index > 2.
There are no elements smaller than 12 having index > 3.
