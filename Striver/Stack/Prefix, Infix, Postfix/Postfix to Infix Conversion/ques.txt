You are given a string that represents the postfix form of a valid mathematical expression. Convert it to its infix form.

Example:

Input:
ab*c+ 
Output: 
((a*b)+c)
Explanation: 
The above output is its valid infix form.
Your Task:

Complete the function string postToInfix(string post_exp), which takes a postfix string as input and returns its infix form.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

Constraints:
