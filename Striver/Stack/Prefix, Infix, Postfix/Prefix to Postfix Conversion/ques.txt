Prefix to Postfix Conversion

You are given a string that represents the prefix form of a valid mathematical expression. Convert it to its postfix form.

Example:

Input: 
*-A/BC-/AKL
Output: 
ABC/-AK/L-*
Explanation: 
The above output is its valid postfix form.
Your Task:

Complete the function preToPost(string pre_exp), which takes a prefix string as input and returns its postfix form.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

Constraints:

3<=pre_exp.length()<=100
