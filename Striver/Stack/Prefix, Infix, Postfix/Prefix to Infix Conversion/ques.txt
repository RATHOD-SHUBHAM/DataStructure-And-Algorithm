Prefix to Infix Conversion

You are given a string S of size N that represents the prefix form of a valid mathematical expression. Convert it to its infix form.

Example 1:

Input: 
*-A/BC-/AKL
Output: 
((A-(B/C))*((A/K)-L))
Explanation: 
The above output is its valid infix form.
Your Task:

Complete the function string preToInfix(string pre_exp), which takes a prefix string as input and return its infix form.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

Constraints:

3<=|S|<=104
