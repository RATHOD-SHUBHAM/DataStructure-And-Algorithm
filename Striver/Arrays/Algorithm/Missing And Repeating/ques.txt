Missing And Repeating

Given an unsorted array arr of size n of positive integers. One number 'A' from set {1, 2,....,N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. Find these two numbers.
Your task is to complete the function findTwoElement() which takes the array of integers arr and n as parameters and returns an array of integers of size 2 denoting the answer (The first index contains B and second index contains A)

Examples

Input: n = 2 arr[] = {2, 2}
Output: 2 1
Explanation: Repeating number is 2 and smallest positive missing number is 1.
Input: n = 3 arr[] = {1, 3, 3} 
Output: 3 2
Explanation: Repeating number is 3 and smallest positive missing number is 2.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
2 ≤ n ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n
