Second Largest

Given an array Arr of size N, print second largest distinct element from an array.

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 6
Arr[] = {12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1}
Output: 34
Explanation: The largest element of the 
array is 35 and the second largest element
is 34.
Example 2:

Input: 
N = 3
Arr[] = {10, 5, 10}
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest element of 
the array is 10 and the second 
largest element is 5.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function print2largest() which takes the array of integers arr and n as parameters and returns an integer denoting the answer. If 2nd largest element doesn't exist then return -1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
2 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Arri ≤ 105
