Third largest Non Distinct element


Given an array of elements. Find the third largest element in it.

Suppose you have A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, its output will be 5 because it is the 3 largest element in the array A.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
A[] = {2,4,1,3,5}
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input:
N = 3
A[] = {5,5,5}
Output: -1


Input:
N = 4
A[] = {5,4,4,3}
Output: 3


Your Task:
Complete the function thirdLargest() which takes the array a[] and the size of the array, n, as input parameters and returns the third largest element in the array. It return -1 if there are less than 3 elements in the given array.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 105
