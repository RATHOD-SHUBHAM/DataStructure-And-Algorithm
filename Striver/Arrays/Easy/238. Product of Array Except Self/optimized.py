Product of sum except self -> what this means is, 
    * Get me the product of all left side array.
    * Get me the product of all right side array.
    * Combine them together and that is the product of entire array except self.

For array 1, 2, 3, 4

Product of all array from left to 3, excluding 3 is 2
--------
1, 1, 2,| 4
--------

Product of all array from right to 3, excluding 3 is 4
        --------
24, 12, | 4, 1
        --------


Now combine left and right 2 * 4 = 8, this is product of array 3 except self
