Count Primes In Range

Given two numbers L and R(L<R). Count all the prime numbers in the range [L, R].

Example 1:

Input:
L=1,R=10
Output:
4
Explanation:
There are 4 primes in this range, 
which are 2,3,5 and 7.
Example 2:

Input:
L=5,R=10
Output:
2
Explanation:
There are 2 primes in this range, 
which are 5 and 7.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countPrimes() which takes the two integers L and R as input parameters and returns the number of prime numbers in the range [L, R].


Expected Time Complexity:O(RLogLog(R))
Expected Auxillary Space:O(R)


Constraints:
1<=L<R<=2*105
