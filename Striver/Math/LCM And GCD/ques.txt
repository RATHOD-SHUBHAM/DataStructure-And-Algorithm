LCM And GCD

Given two integers a and b, write a function lcmAndGcd() to compute their LCM and GCD. The function takes two integers a and b as input and returns a list containing their LCM and GCD.

Example 1:

Input: a = 5 , b = 10
Output: 10 5
Explanation: LCM of 5 and 10 is 10, while their GCD is 5.
Input: a = 14 , b = 8
Output: 56 2
Explanation: LCM of 14 and 8 is 56, while their GCD is 2.
Expected Time Complexity: O(log(min(a, b))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= a, b <= 109
