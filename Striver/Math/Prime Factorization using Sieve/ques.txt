Prime Factorization using Sieve

You are given a positive number N. Using the concept of Sieve, compute its prime factorisation.

Example:

Input: 
N = 12246
Output: 
2 3 13 157
Explanation: 
2*3*13*157 = 12246 = N.
Your Task:

Comple the function findPrimeFactors(), which takes a positive number N as input and returns a vector consisting of prime factors. You should implement Sieve algorithm to solve this problem.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(Nlog(log(N)).

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

Constraints:

2<=N<=2*105
