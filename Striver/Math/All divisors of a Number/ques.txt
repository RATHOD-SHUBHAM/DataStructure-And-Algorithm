All divisors of a Number

Given an integer N, print all the divisors of N in the ascending order.
 

Example 1:

Input : 20
Output: 1 2 4 5 10 20
Explanation: 20 is completely 
divisible by 1, 2, 4, 5, 10 and 20.

Example 2:

Input: 21191
Output: 1 21191
Explanation: As 21191 is a prime number,
it has only 2 factors(1 and the number itself).

Your Task:

Your task is to complete the function print_divisors() which takes N as input parameter and prints all the factors of N as space seperated integers in sorted order. You don't have to print any new line after printing the desired output. It will be handled in driver code.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(sqrt(N))
Expected Space Complexity: O(sqrt(N))
 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
