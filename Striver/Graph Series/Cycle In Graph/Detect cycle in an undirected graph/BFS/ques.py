Detect cycle in an undirected graph

Given an undirected graph with V vertices and E edges, check whether it contains any cycle or not. Graph is in the form of adjacency list where adj[i] contains all the nodes ith node is having edge with.

Example 1:

Input:  
V = 5, E = 5
adj = {{1}, {0, 2, 4}, {1, 3}, {2, 4}, {1, 3}} 
Output: 1
Explanation: 

1->2->3->4->1 is a cycle.
Example 2:

Input: 
V = 4, E = 2
adj = {{}, {2}, {1, 3}, {2}}
Output: 0
Explanation: 

No cycle in the graph.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isCycle() which takes V denoting the number of vertices and adjacency list as input parameters and returns a boolean value denoting if the undirected graph contains any cycle or not, return 1 if a cycle is present else return 0.

NOTE: The adjacency list denotes the edges of the graph where edges[i] stores all other vertices to which ith vertex is connected.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Expected Space Complexity: O(V)


 

Constraints:
1 ≤ V, E ≤ 105
