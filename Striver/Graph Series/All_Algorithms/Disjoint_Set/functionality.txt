# Disjoint Set:
    Helps us identify if nodes belong to same graph/component or not.

    Main idea is to find parents.


# Disjoint Set has 2 Functionality:
    1. Find Parent.
    2. Perform Union:
        * Union can be performed in 2 ways.
            a. Union by `Rank`.
            b. Union by 'Size`.

# Time Complexity:
    Disjoint runs in O(4É‘) == O(1)
