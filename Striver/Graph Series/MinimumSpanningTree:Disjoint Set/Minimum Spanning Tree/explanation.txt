# Spanning Tree:
    A spanning tree is a tree in which we have 
        * N nodes(i.e. All the nodes present in the original graph) and, 
        * N-1 edges and, 
        all nodes are reachable from each other.


# Note: 
    Point to remember is that a graph may have more than one spanning trees.


# Minimum Spanning Tree:
    Among all possible spanning trees of a graph, 
    the minimum spanning tree is the one for which the sum of all the edge weights is the minimum.

# Algorithm:
    1. Prim’s algorithm.  
    2. Kruskal’s algorithm.

# Disjoint Set:
    Helps us identify if nodes belong to same graph/component or not.

    Main idea is to find parents.
