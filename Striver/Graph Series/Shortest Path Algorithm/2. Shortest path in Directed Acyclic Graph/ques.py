Shortest path in Directed Acyclic Graph

Given a Directed Acyclic Graph of N vertices from 0 to N-1 and a 2D Integer array(or vector) edges[ ][ ] of length M, where there is a directed edge from edge[i][0] to edge[i][1] with a distance of edge[i][2] for all i, 0<=i

Find the shortest path from src(0) vertex to all the vertices and if it is impossible to reach any vertex, then return -1 for that vertex.

 

Example:

Input:
n = 6, m= 7
edge=[[0,1,2],[0,4,1],[4,5,4]
,[4,2,2],[1,2,3],[2,3,6],[5,3,1]]

Output:
0 2 3 6 1 5
 

Your Task:

You don't need to print or input anything. Complete the function shortest path() which takes an integer N as number of vertices, an integer M as number of edges and a 2D Integer array(or vector) edges as the input parameters and returns an integer array(or vector), denoting the list of distance from src to all nodes.

 

Constraint:

1 <= n,m <= 100
0 <= edgei,0,edgei,1 < n
 
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N+E), where N is the number of nodes and E is edges

Expected Space Complexity: O(N)
