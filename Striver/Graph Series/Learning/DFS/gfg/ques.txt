DFS of Graph

Given a connected undirected graph containing V vertices represented by a 2-d adjacency list adj[][], where each adj[i] represents the list of vertices connected to vertex i. Perform a Depth First Search (DFS) traversal starting from vertex 0, visiting vertices from left to right as per the given adjacency list, and return a list containing the DFS traversal of the graph.

Note: Do traverse in the same order as they are in the given adjacency list.

Examples:

Input: adj[][] = [[2, 3, 1], [0], [0, 4], [0], [2]]

Output: [0, 2, 4, 3, 1]
Explanation: Starting from 0, the DFS traversal proceeds as follows:
Visit 0 → Output: 0 
Visit 2 (the first neighbor of 0) → Output: 0, 2 
Visit 4 (the first neighbor of 2) → Output: 0, 2, 4 
Backtrack to 2, then backtrack to 0, and visit 3 → Output: 0, 2, 4, 3 
Finally, backtrack to 0 and visit 1 → Final Output: 0, 2, 4, 3, 1
Input: adj[][] = [[1, 2], [0, 2], [0, 1, 3, 4], [2], [2]]

Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation: Starting from 0, the DFS traversal proceeds as follows: 
Visit 0 → Output: 0 
Visit 1 (the first neighbor of 0) → Output: 0, 1 
Visit 2 (the first neighbor of 1) → Output: 0, 1, 2 
Visit 3 (the first neighbor of 2) → Output: 0, 1, 2, 3 
Backtrack to 2 and visit 4 → Final Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

Constraints:
1 ≤ V = adj.size() ≤ 104
1 ≤ adj[i][j] ≤ 104
