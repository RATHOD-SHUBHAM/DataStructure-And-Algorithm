📝 Problem Statement

Problem: One or Zero Edit Distance

Given two strings s and t, return true if they are at most one edit apart, otherwise return false.

An edit is defined as:

Insert a character into one string.

Delete a character from one string.

Replace a character in one string with another character.

👉 Two strings are considered "at most one edit apart" if you can make zero or one of the above operations to make them equal.

🔹 Example 1
Input: s = "hit", t = "hot"
Output: true
Explanation: Replace 'i' with 'o'

🔹 Example 2
Input: s = "cat", t = "cat"
Output: true
Explanation: They are already equal (0 edits).

🔹 Example 3
Input: s = "cats", t = "cat"
Output: true
Explanation: Delete 's'

🔹 Example 4
Input: s = "cat", t = "dog"
Output: false
Explanation: More than one edit needed

🔹 Constraints

0 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^4

s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

✨ This is the first problem (at most one edit).
The LeetCode version (#161: One Edit Distance) is the stricter exactly one edit version.
