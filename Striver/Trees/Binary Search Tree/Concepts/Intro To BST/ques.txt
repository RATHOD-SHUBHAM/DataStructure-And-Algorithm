Binary Search Trees

Given an array of integers arr[] representing inorder traversal of elements of a binary tree. Return true if the given inorder traversal can be of a valid Binary Search Tree.

Note - In a valid Binary Search Tree all keys are unique.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [8, 14, 45, 64, 100]
Output: True
Input: arr[] = [5, 6, 1, 8, 7]
Output: False
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)

Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105

1 <= arr[i] <= 109
