'''
Selection sort works by taking the smallest element in an unsorted array and bringing it to the front. 
Youâ€™ll go through each item (from left to right) until you find the smallest one. 
The first item in the array is now sorted, while the rest of the array is unsorted.

# Tc: O(n^2) | Sc: O(n)

def selectionSort(array):
    n = len(array)

    # traverse and place the min val in right place
    for i in range(n):
        
        min_val = array[i]

        for j in range(i, n):

            cur_val = array[j]
            
            # If the current val < min_val, push it in front of current val
            if min_val > cur_val:

                min_val = cur_val
                
                array[i] , array[j] = array[j] , array[i]

    return array
