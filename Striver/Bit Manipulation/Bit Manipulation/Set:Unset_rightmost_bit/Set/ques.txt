Set the rightmost unset bit

Given a non-negative number n . The problem is to set the rightmost unset bit in the binary representation of n.

Examples :

Input: n = 6
Output: 7
Explanation: The binary representation of 6 is 110. After setting right most bit it becomes 111 which is 7.
Input: n = 15
Output: 31
Explanation: The binary representation of 15 is 01111. After setting right most bit it becomes 11111 which is 31.
Expected Time Complexity: O(Logn)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
