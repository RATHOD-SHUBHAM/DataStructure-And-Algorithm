UnSet the rightmost set bit

Given a non-negative number n . The problem is to un-set the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of n.

Examples :

Input: n = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: The binary representation of 7 is 0111. After un-setting right most bit it becomes 0110 which is 6.

Expected Time Complexity: O(Logn)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
