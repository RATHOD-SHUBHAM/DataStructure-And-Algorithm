Bit Manipulation

Given a 32 bit unsigned integer num and an integer i. Perform following operations on the number - 

1. Get ith bit

2. Set ith bit

3. Clear ith bit

Note : For better understanding, we are starting bits from 1 instead 0. (1-based). You have to print space three space seperated values ( as shown in output ) and do not have to return anything.

Examples :

Input: 70 3
Output: 1 70 66
Explanation: Bit at the 3rd position from LSB is 1. (1 0 0 0 1 1 0) .The value of the given number after setting the 3rd bit is 70. The value of the given number after clearing 3rd bit is 66. (1 0 0 0 0 1 0)
Input: 8 1
Output: 0 9 8
Explanation: Bit at the first position from LSB is 0. (1 0 0 0)  .The value of the given number after setting the 1st bit is 9. (1 0 0 1).  The value of the given number after clearing 1st bit is 8. (1 0 0 0)
 

Constraints:

0<=num<=109

1<=i<=32
