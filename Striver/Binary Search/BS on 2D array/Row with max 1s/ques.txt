Row with max 1s

You are given a 2D binary array arr[][] consisting of only 1s and 0s. Each row of the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. Your task is to find and return the index of the first row that contains the maximum number of 1s. If no such row exists, return -1.

Note:

The array follows 0-based indexing.
The number of rows and columns in the array are denoted by n and m respectively.
Examples:

Input: arr[][] = [[0,1,1,1], [0,0,1,1], [1,1,1,1], [0,0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Row 2 contains the most number of 1s (4 1s). Hence, the output is 2.
Input: arr[][] = [[0,0], [1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Row 1 contains the most number of 1s (2 1s). Hence, the output is 1.
Input: arr[][] = [[0,0], [0,0]]
Output: -1
Explanation: No row contains any 1s, so the output is -1.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size(), arr[i].size() ≤ 103
0 ≤ arr[i][j] ≤ 1
