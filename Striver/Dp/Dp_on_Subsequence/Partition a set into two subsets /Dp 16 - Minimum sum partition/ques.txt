Minimum sum partition

Given an array arr[]  containing non-negative integers, the task is to divide it into two sets set1 and set2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum and find the minimum difference.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 6, 11, 5]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12 
Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11 
Hence, minimum difference is 1.  

Input: arr[] = [1, 4]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Subset1 = {1}, sum of Subset1 = 1
Subset2 = {4}, sum of Subset2 = 4
Hence, minimum difference is 3.

Input: arr[] = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Subset1 = {1}, sum of Subset1 = 1
Subset2 = {}, sum of Subset2 = 0
Hence, minimum difference is 1.


Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size()*|sum of array elements| ≤ 105
1 <= arr[i] <= 105
