Introduction to DP

Geek is learning data structures, and he recently learned about the top-down and bottom-up dynamic programming approaches. Geek is having trouble telling them apart from one another.

When given an integer n, where n is based on a 0-based index, find the nth Fibonacci number.

Every ith number in the series equals the sum of the (i-1)th and (i-2)th numbers, where the first and second numbers are specified as 0 and 1, respectively.

For the given issue, code both top-down and bottom-up approaches.

Note : As the answer might be large, return the final answer modulo 109 + 7

Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: 0,1,1,2,3,5 as we can see 5th number is 5.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 6
Output: 8
Explanation: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8 as we can see 6th number is 8.
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 104

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete two functions topDown() and bottomUp() which take n as input parameters and return the nth Fibonacci number.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)
