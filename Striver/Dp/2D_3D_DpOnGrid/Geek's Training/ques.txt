Geek's Training

Geek is going for a training program for n days. He can perform any of these activities: Running, Fighting, and Learning Practice. Each activity has some point on each day. As Geek wants to improve all his skills, he can't do the same activity on two consecutive days. Given a 2D array arr[][] of size n where arr[i][0], arr[i][1], and arr[i][2] represent the merit points for Running, Fighting, and Learning on the i-th day, determine the maximum total merit points Geek can achieve .

Example:

Input: arr[]= [[1, 2, 5], [3, 1, 1], [3, 3, 3]]
Output: 11
Explanation: Geek will learn a new move and earn 5 point then on second day he will do running and earn 3 point and on third day he will do fighting and earn 3 points so, maximum merit point will be 11.
Input: arr[]= [[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Geek can perform any activity each day while adhering to the constraints, in order to maximize his total merit points as 6.
Input: arr[]= [[4, 2, 6]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Geek will learn a new move to make his merit points as 6.
Constraint:
1 <=  n <= 105   
1 <=  arr[i][j] <= 100
