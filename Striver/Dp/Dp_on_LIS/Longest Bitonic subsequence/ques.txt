Longest Bitonic subsequence

Given an array of positive integers. Find the maximum length of Bitonic subsequence. 
A subsequence of array is called Bitonic if it is first strictly increasing, then strictly decreasing. Return the maximum length of bitonic subsequence.
 
Note : A strictly increasing or a strictly decreasing sequence should not be considered as a bitonic sequence

Examples :

Input: n = 5, nums[] = [1, 2, 5, 3, 2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The sequence {1, 2, 5} is increasing and the sequence {3, 2} is decreasing so merging both we will get length 5.
Input: n = 8, nums[] = [1, 11, 2, 10, 4, 5, 2, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The bitonic sequence {1, 2, 10, 4, 2, 1} has length 6.
Input: n = 3, nums[] = [10, 20, 30]
Output: 0
Explanation: The decreasing or increasing part cannot be empty
Input: n = 3, nums[] = [10, 10, 10]
Output: 0
Explanation: The subsequences must be strictly increasing or decreasing
Constraints:
1 ≤ length of array ≤ 103
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 104
