"""
‚úÖ Functions Overview
    You have broken the solution into:

    PSEE ‚Äì Previous Smaller Element's Index

    NSEE ‚Äì Next Smaller Element's Index

    calculateBuilding ‚Äì Computes area for each bar

    largestRectangleArea ‚Äì Main driver

‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity
    Let n be the number of elements in heights.

    PSEE and NSEE:

        Each index is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.

        So both PSEE and NSEE run in O(n) time.

    calculateBuilding:

        A single loop over n elements ‚Üí O(n).

    largestRectangleArea:

        Just combines the above and calls max(area) which is also O(n).

üîÅ Total Time Complexity: O(n)

    üß† Space Complexity
        **PSEE, NSEE, area, and stack**: Each uses an array/list of size n`.

        So you use around 4 auxiliary arrays of size n.

    üì¶ Total Space Complexity: O(n)

‚úÖ Final Answer:
    Time Complexity: O(n)

    Space Complexity: O(n)
