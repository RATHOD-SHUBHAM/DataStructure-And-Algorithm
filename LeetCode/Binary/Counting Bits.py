338. Counting Bits
Medium

Given a non negative integer number num.
For every numbers i in the range 0 â‰¤ i â‰¤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation
and return them as an array.

    Even : number / 2 will have same number of ones.
    odd  : number / 2 plus 1 will have the same number of ones.
    Steps: 
        1] Divide the number by 2.
        2] perform and operation in between number and one.
        this step adds one if it is a odd number else it will add zero if it is a even number.
        3] add step 1 and step 2
