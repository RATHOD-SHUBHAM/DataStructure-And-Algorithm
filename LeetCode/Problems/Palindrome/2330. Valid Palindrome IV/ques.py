2330. Valid Palindrome IV

You are given a 0-indexed string s consisting of only lowercase English letters. In one operation, you can change any character of s to any other character.

Return true if you can make s a palindrome after performing exactly one or two operations, or return false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcdba"
Output: true
Explanation: One way to make s a palindrome using 1 operation is:
- Change s[2] to 'd'. Now, s = "abddba".
One operation could be performed to make s a palindrome so return true.
Example 2:

Input: s = "aa"
Output: true
Explanation: One way to make s a palindrome using 2 operations is:
- Change s[0] to 'b'. Now, s = "ba".
- Change s[1] to 'b'. Now, s = "bb".
Two operations could be performed to make s a palindrome so return true.
Example 3:

Input: s = "abcdef"
Output: false
Explanation: It is not possible to make s a palindrome using one or two operations so return false.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
