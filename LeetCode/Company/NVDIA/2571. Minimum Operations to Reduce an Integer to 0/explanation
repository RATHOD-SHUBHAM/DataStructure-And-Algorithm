Intuition
    - we don't care if we need to increase or decrease the value to the power of 2 to achieve the goal
    - Just focus on how to make n become 0 and count the number of times.

In order to bring n to zero, we need to keep subtracting.

Approach
    In order to ensure that n is closer to 0 each time:

    1. Find the power of 2 greater than n and the power of 2 less than n.
    2. Take the smallest difference between n and the power of 2 ( Smaller the difference, closer it is to 0)
    3. Update n using the minimum difference.
    4. Until n to 0.


For example: 
    n = 39    
                  6    5   4  3   2  1  0
    power of 2 = 64 , 32, 16, 8 , 4, 2, 1

    * First time
        - 39 is closer to 64 and 32 
        - n update to min( |32-39|, |64-39| ) = min(7, 25) = 7
    * Second time
        - 7 is closer to 8 and 4 
        - n update to min( |8-7|, |4-7| ) = min(1, 3) = 1
    * Third time 
        - 1 is closer to 1 and 2
        - n update to min( |2-1|, |1-1| ) = min(1, 0) = 0

when n == 0, exit and return 3 - since it took 3 steps to get to 0.
