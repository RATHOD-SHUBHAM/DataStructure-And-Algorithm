206. Reverse Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
Example 3:

Input: head = []
Output: []
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
 

Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
