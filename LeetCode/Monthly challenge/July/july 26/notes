236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree.

* The lowest common ancestor is defined between 2 nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both node p and q as descendants. ( where we allow a node to be descendant of itself)

* lowest node t, that has p adn q as its child.
* t itself can be one among p and q

# solve using recursion
# solv using iteration

# both use the same Tc and Sc of O(n)
