Notes:

- Works only on DAG => Directed Acyclic Graph.

- In topological sorting, 
    * Linear ordering of vertices such that if there is a edge between `u` and `v`, then `u` appears before `v`.
    
    * node `u` will always appear before node `v` if there is a directed edge from node u towards node v
    `(u -> v)`.

- A graph may have multiple topological sortings.

- Should not have a `Cycle`
