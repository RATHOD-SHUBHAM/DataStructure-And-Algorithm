# Data Structures & Algorithm in Python 😎

---

<p align="center">
  This repo contains solutions to algorithmic problems from various platforms like </br>
  <b>NeetCode, Strivers A2Z DSA Course/Sheet, LeetCode, AlgoExpert, HackerRank, CodeSignal.</b>
  </br>
</p>

### 🔥 **Note**:
    * The solutions are all written in **Python**.
    * `a1.py` is an abbreviation of `all in one`. i.e.,  if a problem can be solved in multiple ways, then `a1.py` has all the solutions in a single file. (Just to make it easy, to compare and get the flow of how brute force can be changed to optimal solution)

### 🤔 How to use?

    To run the programs, 
    * First clone the repository
    * Then cd into xxx folder,
    * Now use `python3 filename.py` command to execute the code.🤝
