'''
Given an array, print the Next Smaller Element (NSE) for every element. The NSE for an element x is the first smaller element on the right side of x in the array. Elements for which no smaller element exist (on the right side), consider NSE as -1. 

Examples: 

a) For any array, the rightmost element always has NSE as -1. 
b) For an array that is sorted in increasing order, all elements have NSE as -1. 
c) For the input array [4, 8, 5, 2, 25}, the NSE for each element is as follows.

Element         NSE
   4      -->    2
   8      -->    5
   5      -->    2
   2      -->   -1
   25     -->   -1
d) For the input array [13, 7, 6, 12}, the next smaller elements for each element are as follows.
